# RBNZ

The RBNZ package allows users to download data from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand website.

An overview of the package can be found on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RBNZ/vignettes/Overview.html) or in [vignettes/Overview.Rmd](https://github.com/rntq472/RBNZ/blob/master/vignettes/Overview.Rmd).

## Installation

``` r
## Install from CRAN:
install.packages('RBNZ')

## Install the development version from GitHub:
## install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rntq472/RBNZ")

```

## Note - the RBNZ website has been put behind Cloudflare so now there are some extra steps for using this package.

One option is to email the RBNZ and request that your public IP address be whitelisted. The email to contact is listed [here](https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/robots-botnets-and-scrapers-terms-of-service).

The second option is to download the necessary files from the RBNZ website manually through your browser and then use this package to read and organise those files. This can be done as follows:

Users must download the webpage of the series they are interested in and save the html file as series.html. They then must download the spreadsheets needed from that page and save them in the same directory without changing their file names.

For example for the B1 series a user could download the webpage https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/b1 through their browser and save it as B1.html. In the same directory they would download and save the following spreadsheets.

* hb1-daily-1973-1998.xlsx
* hb1-daily-1999-2017.xlsx
* hb1-daily.xlsx

They could then load the data as follows:

``` r

library(RBNZ)

dat <- getSeries('B1', destDir = 'path_to_downloaded_files')

```

The monthly option can be used after downloading hb1-monthly.xlsx and hb1-monthly-1973-1998.xlsx.
